I am a Research Associate at Columbia University, where I work on the DARPA's Computational Cultural Understanding (CCU) program. I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at Columbia in 2023, after obtaining dual degrees in Computer Science (B.S.) and Studio Art (B.A.) from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2021.


My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and Multimodal Learning. Recent, my work has focused on leveraging data in the wild to enhance the understanding of affective tasks in computational models.
